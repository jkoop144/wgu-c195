# wgu-c195
This repo contains the fully completed project for my WGU C195 class. This class covers creating a java application using a MySQL backend database using the Netbeans 8.2 editor. Since the database was provided by WGU, this project will not run as is. A new database will need to be created for this program to interact with. This project did pass on the first submittion.
